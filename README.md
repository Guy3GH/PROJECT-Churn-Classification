# PROJECT-Churn-Classification
**This repository deals with a churn classification problem, using a machine learning approach.**

The dataset contains details regarding a bank's customers:
+ Surname
+ CreditScore	
+ Geography
+ Gender	
+ Age	
+ Tenure
+ Balance
+ NumOfProducts
+ HasCrCard	
+ IsActiveMember
+ EstimatedSalary	
+ Exited (target variable)

**Project Summary:** (cited from inside the notebook)

_"We have used many different types of ML algorithms, and chose a random forest to be the final classifier. 
Throughout the project, we paid attention to other measures than accuracy, and never touched the test set until final evaluation of the model's capabilities.
We have witnessed how misleading the ROC curve can be. We have reached an f1 score of 62.6% on the test set.
Accuracy is just slightly worse then in others kernels (a few percents less), **but f1 is significantly higher**"._
